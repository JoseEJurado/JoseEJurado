- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoseEJurado
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, data science, and just coding in general! I enjoy playing video games and mechanics behind them,
so some of my code might be somewhat game-related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Python but hope to become well-rounded in other languages as well (Javascript, HTML, CSS).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I am always open to learning new things and challenging myself.
- 📫 How to reach me: esojjurado@gmail.com
